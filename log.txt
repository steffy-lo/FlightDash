human: sg
ai: Here are the travel restrictions I've found for SG.
Authorities in Singapore have been relying on strict social distancing measures to tackle period COVID-19 outbreaks. Singapore's healthcare system is well-equipped which helped authorities quickly implement health screening and testing measures. Authorities have planned to ease restrictions further in the near-term to allow most economic activities to restart after a majority of the population get vaccinated.

Disease Risk Level: High.
