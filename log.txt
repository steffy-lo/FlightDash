human: Canada
ai: Here are the check entry requirements I've found for Canada.
The entry requirements are: The United States (US) and Canadian governments agreed to close the US-Canada border to unvaccinated travellers until 21 September. Fully vaccinated travellers, those engaged in commercial trade and those with cross-border work permits were unaffected. All travellers who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be permitted to enter Canada without quarantine or post-arrival testing. Foreign nationals who are immediate family members of Canadian citizens or permanent residents and who do not have or display any symptoms of COVID-19, as well as air crew, diplomats, seasonal workers, caregivers and international students are also exempt from the entry ban. Airline passengers will be permitted to transit through Canadian airports. An ongoing ban on traffic of cruise ships and pleasure crafts with a capacity of at least 100 passengers in Canada's territorial waters was extended until 1 November.
