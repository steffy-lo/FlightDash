human: Germany
ai: Here are the travel restrictions I've found for Germany.
Germany confirmed its first COVID-19 case on 28 January 2020 after a man from Starnberg, Bavaria, tested positive for the virus. While most measures on social contact, businesses and domestic tourism have been eased, health officials declared in August 2021 that the country has entered a "fourth wave" of the COVID-19 outbreak following the spread of the delta virus variant.

Disease Risk Level: High.
ai: Anything else I can help you with?
